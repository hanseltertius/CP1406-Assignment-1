<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>This website intended to improve the connectivity between customers by providing the latest updates in the shop to make the customers know what our current promotions and what we are currently selling. Besides, this website is made to improve the number of customers in different age groups and to improve the company.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>For the next 3 months, this website has to keep updated by providing the latest updates on this site and if possible, to add some new arrivals in this period. After 3 months since this website has been created, we have to compare the number of customers, number of people who joined the party, the number of items that we sell and the number of quantities that the costume produced, which makes us to know the amount of new customers, and the development of the company from the beginning of the website.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Although our customers are mostly adults, this website is more intended to attract 18 to 29 years old customers but it is possible for children since they loves to wear costumes. </p>
<p>So, we are intended to design this webpage with a white background, which is more simple and user-friendly. For the colour selection, we choose light purple as the main colour because it symbolized as the most popular unisex colors and it is attractive to the children.</p>
